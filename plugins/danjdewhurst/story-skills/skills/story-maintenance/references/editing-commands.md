# Editing Commands

How the commands that create, rename, move, split, merge, and remove entity files, and the `import` that builds a project from a manuscript, behave, and what to check after them. `SKILL.md` says when to run each command; read the matching section here before running one or explaining its result. Run any of them with `--dry-run` first when the change touches many files. `docs/cli-reference.md` lists every flag.

## add, rename, and remove

`add`, `rename`, `move`, and `remove` for deterministic entity file operations when they fit the requested change.

- `add` takes ids, not names, for reference options (`--planted chapter-01`, `--pov mara-quill`), and `add scene` needs its chapter to exist, so add the chapter first.
- Ids stay ASCII kebab-case. Cyrillic and Greek names are transliterated (`story add character 'Пётр'` writes `characters/petr.md` and keeps `name: Пётр`), but a name in a script with no transliteration table (`李明`) needs the id by hand: `story add character '李明' --id li-ming` writes `characters/li-ming.md`, and `story rename <kind> <id> '<New Name>' --id <new-id>` does the same on a rename. `--id` is refused for chapters and scenes, whose ids come from their numbers.
- `rename` rewrites the id in frontmatter and links but leaves chapter prose alone. Add `--prose` when the chapter text should use the new name too: preview with `story rename <kind> <id> '<New Name>' --prose --dry-run`, show the user the replacements, and run it without `--dry-run` only once they approve. `--prose` works for characters, locations, factions, artifacts, systems, and terms. It rewrites only drafted chapters: an `outline` chapter keeps the old name, so list them with `story list chapters --where status=outline` and update their text by hand. It leaves aliases as written, and lists the matches it left alone (a name that may be an ordinary word, a reference-link label) for you to check by hand; the `character-management` skill has the full steps. `rename` never changes a chapter or scene id: use `move`.
- `remove chapter` refuses while scene files point at the chapter, so remove those scenes first; it walks back ledger statuses that relied on the chapter (planted to planned, paid-off to planted or planned, answered or resolved questions to open), so review the ledgers afterwards.

## move

`move` whenever a chapter's number or a scene's chapter or position changes, never a hand rename: chapter and scene ids encode their numbers.

- `story move chapter <id> --number <n>` renames the chapter and its scene files, sets `number` and the `# Chapter N:` heading, and rewrites every reference to the old id (scene `chapter`, clue and promise `planted`/`payoff`, question `introduced`/`resolved`, research `used-in`, `died-in`, `continuity/state.md` `since`/`learned-in` and `current-chapter`, markdown links, and bare ids in `plot/timeline.md` and arc bodies).
- A taken number is refused (`chapter-05 already exists: move it first. To make room, renumber from the highest chapter down`), so to insert a chapter move the later chapters up one, highest first, then `add chapter --number <n>`.
- `story move scene <id> --chapter <chapter-id>` moves a scene to the next free number in that chapter (`--scene <n>` picks the number, and `--scene` alone reorders within the chapter) and adds its location and characters to the new chapter; give at least one of the two.
- `move` works only on chapters and scenes (use `rename` for other ids), never edits prose or outline beats that mention a chapter number, and reindexes.
- References are written before the files move, so rerun an interrupted move: it first puts back what the stopped move changed.

## split and merge

`split` and `merge` to split a chapter in two or join two neighbouring chapters, instead of moving prose and renumbering by hand.

- `story split <chapter-id> --at '<marker>'` keeps the text before the marker and makes the rest the next chapter (`--title` names it; default `<title> (continued)`), moving the later chapters up one. The marker is a scene break number (`--at 2`), a heading, or a unique line of the chapter text. Scene records after the split move with their text, by order.
- `story merge <chapter-id> <next-chapter-id>` appends the second chapter's prose after a scene break, adds its outline beats, notes, scenes, and list fields to the first, points every reference to it at the first, and moves the later chapters down one.
- In a branching book (one with `choices`), both work only on chapters with no choices, and `merge` only when no choice leads to the second chapter; anything else is refused, naming the choices in the way. The renumbering points every choice at the new ids, and a split gives the first half a `Continue` choice that leads to the rest, so ask the user whether to reword it. Both list each choice they add or point elsewhere, under `--dry-run` too.
- `split` also refuses when it would give a chapter (the last one it renumbers, or the new one when none follows) a `chapter-NN` that a file already names, such as a payoff scheduled for a chapter not written yet. Only abandoned threads naming the new chapter's id are let through, with an `adopted-references` warning. Ask the user which chapter those references mean, point them where the message says (the chapter they belong to, or the next id), then run it again.
- Run `--dry-run` first and show the user the list. A split or merge stopped part way (`interrupted-change` from `story validate`) is put back by running it again, which then splits or merges, or by `story doctor --fix`; until then every other write command is refused.
- Then work through the warnings: `split-references` lists files that still name the split chapter (a clue, death, or progression there may now belong to the new chapter, which the CLI cannot tell), `split-scenes` says scene records were assigned by order, and `merge-conflicts` lists fields the two chapters set differently, including `numbered: false` on only one of them (the merged chapter keeps the first chapter's numbering).
- Neither edits prose, so reread for chapter numbers in the text.

See the `revision-continuity` skill.

## add matter

`add matter` when the user wants a dedication, epigraph, copyright page, acknowledgments, author's note, about-the-author, or also-by page.

- Pages live in `matter/` (indexed in `matter/_index.md` by reindex) with `title`, `placement` (`front` or `back`), `order`, and `heading` (pass `--heading=false` for a dedication or epigraph, or edit the scaffolded `heading:` key; never add a second one).
- Write the page text directly in the file; unwritten pages are left out of builds and `validate` warns about them.
- Never invent acknowledgments, biographical facts, or copyright details: ask the user for them.
- Matter pages that quote others' work (an epigraph, song lyrics) may record `permission` (`not-needed`, `pending`, `granted`, `public-domain`), `rights-holder`, and `credit`; `validate` warns when `permission: pending` remains on a complete story and when `granted` has no `rights-holder`, and export and the builds leave a `pending` page out (warning `permission-pending-left-out`) unless `--include-pending` is given.

See the `editorial-review` skill.

## add research

`add research` when the story relies on a real-world fact: notes live in `research/` with `status` (`open`, `verified`, `disputed`), whole-citation `sources`, and `used-in` chapter ids, plus optional `--accuracy` (`must-be-accurate`, `blended`, `invented`), `--confidence` (`high`, `medium`, `low`), `--method` (`fact`, `interview`, `site-visit`, `expert-review`, `reading`), and repeatable `--risk` (`legal`, `medical`, `weapons`, `safety`, `cultural`, `defamation`, `technical`).

`validate` warns when a final chapter relies on open or disputed research (invented notes never trigger this), and when a note with a `risk` is used in a final or complete chapter with no `reviewed-by`.

See the `research` skill.

## import

`import` when the user has an existing manuscript or chapter drafts and wants a Story Skills project built from them.

- Follow up by creating character and location files from the printed entity candidates, and by setting `form` and `target-words` in `story.md` (import refuses `--form`; without them `story validate` never checks length and `story progress` has no target).
- Directory sources import in natural file-name order (`chapter-2` before `chapter-10`).
- `import --force` into an existing directory deletes every `chapter-NN.md` in `chapters/` before writing the imported chapters, so confirm with the user before forcing an import over a project with drafted chapters. It first saves the project as snapshot `before-import-<n>` and prints `story snapshot --restore before-import-<n>`; tell the user that name, since that restore puts the old chapters back.
- A Story Skills chapter file keeps its `author`; for a collection or anthology of other files, add `--bylines` to set each chapter's `author` from the by-line opening its prose (`By Ben Other`, taken out of the prose) or its file's frontmatter `author`. A line that is not clearly a by-line stays in the prose, so check the chapters left without `author` and set it by hand.
