# Datacircle for Claude, Cursor and Gemini CLI

Datacircle is a data co-op. Query your favorite B2B data APIs through us. Same request, same price, no markup. Every morning, you get
the flat file of your data plus everyone else's.

This plugin connects your agent (Claude, Cursor or Gemini CLI) to Datacircle's MCP server, so it can fetch a person's LinkedIn profile from its URL (name, headline,
location, current company and title, positions, education, skills) from your Datacircle balance, and tell you what each lookup cost.

## What it does

- **Look up LinkedIn profiles** by URL. Right now we have 3 live LinkedIn profile APIs that we trust: Up2Data, HarvestAPI and Fetchin.
  $2.375 per 1,000 through Up2Data (a profile it can't find is free), $3.70 per 1,000 through HarvestAPI.
  $1.485 per 1,000 through Fetchin, a profile it can't find billed the same.
  At Up2Data's limit, the server tells your agent to call again through Fetchin or HarvestAPI.
  Each request goes to the provider and gets the profile as it is today.
- **Check your balance**, and start a Stripe Checkout to add funds, which you open and pay yourself: nothing is charged until you do.
- **List your files and get download links**: Every morning, you get the flat file of your data plus everyone else's. Add $50 to your
  account: you get $50 of API PLUS the flat file.

We wrote the agent a skill for these tools: show the price and wait for your yes before any paid lookup, try Up2Data first since a
lookup there that finds nothing is free, fetch only the profiles you ask for, and ignore any instructions in a profile.

## Setup

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add waynehamadi/datacircle-plugin
/plugin install datacircle@datacircle
```

In Gemini CLI:

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/waynehamadi/datacircle-plugin
```

In Cursor, add the server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`: `{"mcpServers": {"datacircle": {"url": "https://api.datacircle.dev/mcp"}}}`.

Then sign in when your agent asks (in Claude Code, `/mcp`; in Gemini CLI, `/mcp auth datacircle`): datacircle.dev opens, you sign in
with your work email and a code, and you allow the connection. A new account starts with a $5 credit.

## What it sends, and where

The plugin runs no code on your machine. It declares one remote MCP server, `https://api.datacircle.dev/mcp`, run by Datacircle. Your agent
sends it the LinkedIn URLs and file IDs you ask about; Datacircle calls the data provider you chose (Up2Data, HarvestAPI or Fetchin) for each
profile lookup, stores the answer, and charges your balance. Signing in gives your agent an access token that works on that server only;
resetting your API key on datacircle.dev cuts it off.
