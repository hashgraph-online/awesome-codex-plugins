# Enhancement

Load this reference for Mode C, before modifying an existing HTML presentation. The fixed-stage rules and density limits in `SKILL.md` still bind every change.

### Mode C: Modification Rules

When enhancing existing presentations, fixed-stage fitting is the biggest risk:

1. **Before adding content:** Count existing elements, check against density limits
2. **Adding images:** Fit them inside the 1920×1080 slide canvas. If slide already has max content, split into two slides
3. **Adding text:** Max 4-6 bullets per slide. Exceeds limits? Split into continuation slides
4. **After ANY modification, verify:** the slide stage remains 16:9, no text overflows its card, no panels overlap, and screenshots look correct at 1280×720, one phone viewport, and inside a small iframe (embed mode)
5. **Proactively reorganize:** If modifications will cause overflow, automatically split content and inform the user. Don't wait to be asked

**When adding images to existing slides:** Move image to a new slide or reduce other content first. Never add images without checking if existing content already fills the 1920×1080 slide stage.
