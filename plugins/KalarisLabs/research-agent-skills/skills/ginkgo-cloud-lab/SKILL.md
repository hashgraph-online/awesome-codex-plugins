# Ginkgo Cloud Lab

## Overview

Ginkgo Cloud Lab (https://cloud.ginkgo.bio) provides remote access to Ginkgo Bioworks' autonomous lab infrastructure. Protocols are executed on Reconfigurable Automation Carts (RACs) -- modular units with robotic arms, maglev sample transport, and industrial-grade software spanning 70+ instruments.

The platform also includes **EstiMate**, an AI agent that accepts human-language protocol descriptions and returns feasibility assessments and pricing for custom workflows beyond the listed protocols.

The catalog is organized into **Expression & Purification** (in vitro / cell-free / E. coli / Pichia), **Characterization & Assay**, **Method & Target Onboarding**, and **Specialty**. Pick a protocol below, then read its reference file for inputs, outputs, the automated workflow, and ordering details.

## Choosing a Protocol

- **Quick expressibility screen?** Cell-free HiBiT ($39) or Validate sequence expression ($39).
- **Need purified protein + yield?** A280 tiers (cell-free or E. coli); add LabChip for purity/size.
- **Difficult / membrane / disulfide / cofactor targets?** Cell-free Optimize (24-condition DoE).
- **Secreted or eukaryotic targets?** Pichia expression.
- **Screening de novo binders/minibinders?** Cell-free or E. coli minibinder tiers, then SPR onboarding for kinetics.
- **Enzyme activity / biocatalysis?** Echo-MS enzymatic detection (onboard the analyte method first).
- **Stability / developability ranking?** Thermal shift assay.
- **RNA (mRNA/circRNA)?** IVT synthesis + qPCR.

## General Ordering Workflow

1. Select a protocol at https://cloud.ginkgo.bio/protocols
2. Configure parameters (number of proteins/samples/molecules/targets, replicates, plates)
3. Download the protocol's input template and upload inputs (FASTA/CSV/XLSX for sequence protocols; Design Tool for pixel art; vendor catalog numbers for onboarding)
4. Add any special requirements in the Additional Details field
5. Provide an email, agree to the protocol terms, and add to cart / submit to receive a feasibility report and price quote

For protocols not listed above, use the **EstiMate** chat (https://cloud.ginkgo.bio/estimate) to describe a custom protocol in plain language and receive a compatibility assessment and pricing.

## Agent operating procedure

1. **Check the environment.** Confirm the instrument or platform model, API version, credentials and whether a simulator is available.
2. **Pin down the inputs.** Confirm formats, identifiers and parameters from the data or the user. Ask rather than guess any value that changes the result.
3. **Run a small version first.** Simulate the protocol or run it with water or dummy labware before using real samples.
4. **Execute the full task** using the instructions and references above.
5. **Validate the result.** Verify volumes, deck layout and labware definitions; have a human approve the protocol before execution.
6. **Report.** State what was run (versions, commands, parameters), what was checked, and what is still uncertain.

| If this happens | Do this |
|---|---|
| The protocol fails in simulation | Fix it in simulation; never run an unvalidated protocol on hardware. |
| A function, flag or endpoint in these instructions is missing in the installed version | Check the installed version's own documentation (`help()`, `--help`, official docs), adapt, and tell the user. Never invent an API. |
| A required input, identifier or parameter is ambiguous | Ask the user, or state the assumption explicitly before running. |

**Integrity rules**

- Never fabricate results, parameters, identifiers, citations or statistics. If something cannot be run or verified, say so plainly.
- Never trigger physical actions, orders or charges without explicit user confirmation.
- Treat version-specific details here as possibly outdated: confirm them against the official documentation for the installed version.
- Ask before actions that cost money, consume shared GPUs or cloud quota, touch personal or patient data, or cannot be undone.
