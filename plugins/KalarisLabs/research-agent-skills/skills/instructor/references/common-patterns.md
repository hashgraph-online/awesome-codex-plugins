# Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Data Extraction from Text

```python
class CompanyInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    founded_year: int
    industry: str
    employees: int
    headquarters: str

text = """
Tesla, Inc. was founded in 2003. It operates in the automotive and energy
industry with approximately 140,000 employees. The company is headquartered
in Austin, Texas.
"""

company = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"Extract company information from: {text}"
    }],
    response_model=CompanyInfo
)
```

### Pattern 2: Classification

```python
class Category(str, Enum):
    TECHNOLOGY = "technology"
    FINANCE = "finance"
    HEALTHCARE = "healthcare"
    EDUCATION = "education"
    OTHER = "other"

class ArticleClassification(BaseModel):
    category: Category
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    keywords: list[str]

classification = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Classify this article: [article text]"
    }],
    response_model=ArticleClassification
)
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Entity Extraction

```python
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role: str

class Organization(BaseModel):
    name: str
    industry: str

class Entities(BaseModel):
    people: list[Person]
    organizations: list[Organization]
    locations: list[str]

text = "Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, announced at the event in Cupertino..."

entities = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"Extract all entities from: {text}"
    }],
    response_model=Entities
)

for person in entities.people:
    print(f"{person.name} - {person.role}")
```

### Pattern 4: Structured Analysis

```python
class SentimentAnalysis(BaseModel):
    overall_sentiment: Sentiment
    positive_aspects: list[str]
    negative_aspects: list[str]
    suggestions: list[str]
    score: float = Field(ge=-1.0, le=1.0)

review = "The product works well but setup was confusing..."

analysis = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"Analyze this review: {review}"
    }],
    response_model=SentimentAnalysis
)
```

### Pattern 5: Batch Processing

```python
def extract_person(text: str) -> Person:
    return client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Extract person from: {text}"
        }],
        response_model=Person
    )

texts = [
    "John Doe is a 30-year-old engineer",
    "Jane Smith, 25, works in marketing",
    "Bob Johnson, age 40, software developer"
]

people = [extract_person(text) for text in texts]
```
