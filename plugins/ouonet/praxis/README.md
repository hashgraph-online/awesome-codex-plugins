**Praxis** is a discipline framework for AI coding agents. Tell your agent *what you need* and *what done looks like*—not *how to do it*. As AI gets smarter, this gap widens: the agent can apply domain expertise, handle edge cases, and adapt faster than step-by-step instructions allow.

Inspired by [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), rewritten to be significantly cheaper while keeping the core capabilities.

**📖 [Full documentation](https://ouonet.github.io/praxis/)**

## Quick Start

```bash
claude plugins marketplace add ouonet/praxis 
claude plugins install praxis@praxis
claude 'do a todo list app'
```

## How it works

At session start, a hook injects the `praxis:using-praxis` startup skill. It tells your agent:

1. Classify scope inline using the triage table embedded in `using-praxis` — no Skill call needed.
2. Load only the skills that scope needs. **Trivial tasks skip the waterfall entirely.**
3. Follow the loaded skill literally; don't freelance past `<gate>` markers.

## Skills

| Skill     | When                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [onboard](skills/onboard/SKILL.md)   | existing project with no docs/tech-spec.md  |
| [design](skills/design/SKILL.md)    | scope ≥ standard, anything new; also handles vague goals — clarifies before designing |
| [plan](skills/plan/SKILL.md)      | after design                                |
| [tdd](skills/tdd/SKILL.md)       | implementing or fixing                      |
| [debug](skills/debug/SKILL.md)     | something broken                            |
| [review](skills/review/SKILL.md)    | before merge / after subagent task          |
| [worktree](skills/worktree/SKILL.md)  | non-trivial or parallel work                |
| [subagents](skills/subagents/SKILL.md) | independent tasks, fan-out                  |
| [ship](skills/ship/SKILL.md)      | merge / PR / cleanup                        |
| [release](skills/release/SKILL.md)   | version / tag / publish                     |

Skills range from ~100 to ~400 tokens each. Compare to Superpowers' 2,500–3,500 per skill.

## Token budget

|                              | Superpowers   | Praxis                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bootstrap (every session)    | ~2,200        | ~450 (using-praxis + inline triage) |
| Per skill load               | ~2,500–3,500 | ~100–400                            |
| Trivial task                 | ~11,000       | ~450 (bootstrap only)               |
| Standard task (design→ship) | ~30–50k      | ~1,300 (bootstrap + 4 skills)       |
| Complex task (all skills)    | ~40–60k      | ~2,900 (all skills combined)  |

## Documentation Structure

Praxis enforces a strict documentation structure and keeps code and docs in sync at every step.

### Living Documentation

**Living documentation** — describes the current system state and direction. Always in sync with code.

- **`README.md`** — for users: what it is, who for, how to use it
- **`docs/tech-spec.md`** — for developers/agents: current system state ([format](skills/archive/SKILL.md#tech-spec-format))
- **`docs/specs/*.md`** — details split out of the tech-spec when it grows too bulky; referenced by path
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — direction and milestones (exists when project has ≥3 milestones or long-term direction)

`docs/tech-spec.md` uses a structured declaration format:

```
purpose / user / use-case / architecture / stack / entry /
contract / flow / invariant / constraint / convention / milestone
```

Facts only — no interpretation, no plans. If details are bulky — e.g. a complex flow (branching, async, multi-actor) that needs a diagram — split into `docs/specs/` and link; the spec keeps a one-line summary.

**Project artifacts** — records and conventions. Append-only or static.

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — version history, maintained by `ship`
- **`docs/decisions/`** — architectural decision log, append-only

### Staging Area

During active work, Praxis uses:

- **`docs/staging/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`** — Working spec for the current change.
- **`docs/staging/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`** — Executable milestone tasks.

At `ship`, the staging spec merges into living docs; staging files are deleted (Git keeps history).

### Code-Docs Sync

Praxis enforces synchronization at multiple checkpoints:

- **During [`tdd`](skills/tdd/SKILL.md)**: After each RED-GREEN-refactor cycle, sync docs before commit.
  - If staging spec exists → update it to match reality.
  - If no staging spec (small tasks) → update living docs directly.
- **At [`ship`](skills/ship/SKILL.md) gate**: Staging spec must reflect actual code behavior.
- **At [`review`](skills/review/SKILL.md)**: Check that README/comments reflect actual behavior.

**The rule**: Code changes without doc updates fail review. Docs that don't match code block merge.

## Install

### Install from a branch

To try an unreleased branch before it merges:

**Claude Code**
```bash
claude plugins marketplace add ouonet/praxis#<branch>
claude plugins install praxis
```

**OpenCode** — set in `opencode.json`:
```json
{
  "plugin": ["praxis@git+https://github.com/ouonet/praxis.git#<branch>"]
}
```

**Qoder CLI CN** — clone and checkout:
```bash
git clone --branch <branch> https://github.com/ouonet/praxis.git ~/.qoder-cn/praxis
ln -s ~/.qoder-cn/praxis/skills ./skills
```

Replace `<branch>` with the branch name.

---

### Claude Code

```
claude plugins marketplace add ouonet/praxis
claude plugins install praxis
```

To update after new releases:

```
claude plugins update praxis
```

> Claude Code does not auto-update plugins. Run the update command manually after repo changes.

### Codex (CLI / app)

Praxis is distributed as a Codex marketplace. Register the marketplace from the CLI:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ouonet/praxis
```

Then open the plugin directory and install it from the Codex UI:

```
/plugins
```

Search for `praxis` and select **Install Plugin**.

If the marketplace was already added before an update, refresh it first:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade praxis-marketplace
```

### OpenCode

See [`.opencode/INSTALL.md`](.opencode/INSTALL.md).

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```
copilot plugin install ouonet/praxis
```

(Or symlink `.copilot-plugin/plugin.json` per Copilot's plugin convention.)

### VsCode Copilot

```
open customization of copilot -> Plugins -> Install Plugin From Source -> input  "ouonet/praxis"
```

### Antigravity CLI

```
agy plugin install https://github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

Antigravity imports Praxis through the Gemini-compatible plugin path, including the session-start hook.

### Gemini CLI

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/ouonet/praxis
```

The extension loads `skills/using-praxis/SKILL.md` as session context, so triage runs from the first turn.

### Qoder CLI CN

Qoder CLI CN auto-discovers skills from the project's `skills/` directory — no hooks or manual loading needed.

Clone this repo and symlink (or copy) the `skills/` directory into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ouonet/praxis.git ~/.qoder-cn/praxis
ln -s ~/.qoder-cn/praxis/skills ./skills
```

Or install as an SDK plugin by pointing to the `.qoder-plugin/` manifest in your project config.

The `using-praxis` skill is auto-discovered and triggered at session start by its description.

### Manual / fallback

For harnesses without plugin support, add an instruction that reads `skills/using-praxis/SKILL.md` first.

## Verify it's working

Start a fresh session. Send: `let's build a react todo list`.

Expected: outputs `praxis: scope=standard, loading=design,plan,tdd,review` (no `Skill(praxis:triage)` call — triage is inline) and starts asking clarifying questions before touching code.

Send: `fix the typo "teh" in README`.

Expected: agent outputs `praxis: scope=trivial, loading=` and just fixes it. **No design doc, no plan, no TDD ceremony.**

## Examples

### Vague goal

```
You: I want to build something that helps developers manage their workflow
Agent: triage -> vague -> design
```

Design asks one clarifying question per turn until the problem is concrete enough to spec. If exploration produces a knowledge artifact (protocol spec, RE findings), it goes to `docs/decisions/` via `archive`.

### Tiny fix

```
You: fix the typo "teh" in README
Agent: triage -> trivial -> edit -> done
```

### Standard feature

```
You: add OAuth login with GitHub
Agent: triage -> design -> plan -> tdd -> review -> ship
```

Design asks only needed questions, plan writes milestone tasks, ship updates living specs and CHANGELOG `Unreleased`.

### Parallel work

```
You: migrate the entire API from REST to tRPC
Agent: triage -> design -> plan -> worktree -> subagents -> review -> ship
```

Subagents expand milestones at dispatch time; the coordinator reviews and marks tasks complete.

### Onboard existing project

```
You: take over this project / add Praxis to this codebase
Agent: triage -> onboard
```

Onboard explores the codebase and produces `docs/tech-spec.md` — a factual record of stack, contracts, conventions, and invariants. No code changes, no plans. After confirmation, the normal `design → plan → tdd` flow resumes.

### Release

```
You: release 1.2.0
Agent: triage -> release
```

Release confirms the version, moves CHANGELOG `Unreleased`, then asks before commit, tag, push, or publish.

## Common Signals

| You ask                | Praxis does                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| I want to build X (vague) | vague → design (clarifies first) |
| fix typo               | trivial                            |
| add small field        | small -> tdd                       |
| add feature            | standard -> design/plan/tdd/review |
| migrate module         | complex -> worktree/subagents      |
| failing behavior       | debug                              |
| take over this project | onboard                            |
| release 1.2.0          | release                            |

## Compared to Superpowers

Praxis is directly inspired by [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). The core idea is the same: inject structured discipline into an agent session via skill files.

| Superpowers skill                                                 | Praxis equivalent                          |

| `requesting-code-review` / `receiving-code-review`            | `review`                                 |

| `dispatching-parallel-agents` / `subagent-driven-development` | `subagents`                              |
| `finishing-a-development-branch`                                | `ship`                                   |
| `verification-before-completion`                                | gate markers in `tdd` / `ship`         |
| `writing-skills`                                                | — (not needed; skills are plain Markdown) |
| —                                                                | `onboard` (no Superpowers equivalent)    |
| —                                                                | `archive` (no Superpowers equivalent)    |
| —                                                                | `release` (no Superpowers equivalent)    |

**Philosophy difference:** Superpowers gives agents detailed recipes—prose specs, step-by-step plans, narrative reasoning. Praxis gives agents *declarations of intent*—decisions, contracts, validation gates. This works because:

- Agents get smarter; recipes become obsolete. Declarations stay relevant.
- Leaner artifacts = faster iteration and long-term maintainability.
- The agent brings domain knowledge; Praxis provides *what matters*, not *how to do it*.

**Token savings:** The skill files are smaller (avg ~230 vs ~1,760 tokens), and artifacts are too. Praxis `design` outputs a spec (decisions, contracts, invariants) with no narrative; `plan` outputs milestone stubs with one-line goals. At `ship`, working notes are archived and the spec merges into living docs—context stays lean across sessions.

**When to use Superpowers:** You want battle-tested, narrative-rich workflows and token cost isn't a constraint.

**When to use Praxis:** You want agents to think, not follow recipes. You want specs and plans that survive across sessions and scale with AI capability.

## Philosophy

- **Intent, not instruction.** Tell the agent what to achieve and what done looks like. Let it decide how to do it.
- **Pay for discipline only when it pays back.** Triage decides.
- **Skills are short.** If a rule needs 3,000 tokens to express, it's probably not a rule, it's a manual.
- **Cross-harness via env detection,** not per-harness skill copies.
- **No ceremony around the rules** — state each rule once, clearly.
